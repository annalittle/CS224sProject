The Misalignment Museum in San Francisco has an exhibit that consists of a clown doll speaking back to visitors in a clone of their voice, demonstrating the ease of voice cloning. This exhibit sometimes fails due to noisy background environments. Additionally, the exhibit relies on an external API, potentially storing recordings of children's voices externally. By experimenting with various methods for noise reduction, we propose a new pipeline that will do voice cloning locally on a Macbook with better performance in noisy environments and at lower cost to the museum. We accomplish this by processing the incoming sound files using DeepFilterNet, then converting a pre-trained model to sound like the target voice using OpenVoice.

We used the Microsoft Scalable Noisy Dataset for our work. This dataset comes with code to combine the noiseless speech files with the noise files. Using this code, we generated 1 hour of speech for five different speakers. These subsets can be found in separate folders under speaker_data.
